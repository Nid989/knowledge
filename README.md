## About
### A simple `google search` reveals many answers. 

However, googling in itself is one of the greatest skills a developer can possess today. Also, sometimes it takes **hours of google searches** to know what **experience** can tell you in a minute!

This kind of **niche knowledge** is what we aim to document in this repo. For e.g.:
- Simple processes involved in **development, deployment** and **testing** that are **easy but really hard to find** unless you enter the `exact google search keywords`.

- Simple **tricks of the trade** of development you only find **after years of work** in this field which you wish you had known from the beginning!

- **Unbiased knowledge.** 
    
    Companies usually write great blogs about **how to use** their technology. However, they usually do it in such a way that their product is placed in a **spotlight**. The `code` becomes **highly dependent** on their product and cannot work independently. (Hello there **Firebase**!)

    We aim to remove this **bias** and fog surrounding the correct use of technologies and provide only the best practices followed in the industry along with a **Big Picture** view of how a particular `technology` fits in.
